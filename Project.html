            Used an Arduino Uno Microcontroller to create an system that would
            automatically control the blinds on a certain time. In addition, the
            system features an alarm clock and manual control of the blinds.

            Collaborated with a team to create a voice-controlled pottery wheel
            prototype using an Arduino nano 33 BLE sense. The project uses
            python script to recognize certain speech commands and is speaker
            independent.
