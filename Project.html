      <h2>Alarm Clock Project (C++)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Individually developed and tested a device composed of a variety of electronic components with a goal of recreating an alarm clock. </li>
        <li>An Arduino Microcontroller is programmed as the central controller to manage and control the other electronic components.  </li>
      
      </ul>

      <h2>Voice Controlled Pottery Wheel Project (Python, C++)		</h2>

      <p>
        Collaborated with a team to create a voice-controlled pottery wheel
        prototype using an Arduino nano 33 BLE sense. The project uses python
        script to recognize certain speech commands and is speaker independent.
      </p>

      <h2>Tour Application Project (Dart)</h2>
      <p>
        Collaborated with a partner to design an Engineering Tour App using
        Flutter for Mercer University's robotics competition
      </p>
      
      <h2>Neural Network Project (Python) </h2>
      <p>
        Developed a neural network that learns the mechanics within the Hollow Knight Game using Python.
