    <p id="introduction">
      Hello my name is Sebastian Ngo, I major in Computer Engineering at Mercer
      University. Recently I just graduated and am looking to contribute what I
      have learned to companies while learning new things along the way.

      <br />Currently I'm teaching myself web development so that I can become a
      front end developer/engineer.
