      <p>
        Hello my name is Sebastian Ngo, I major in Computer Engineering at
        Mercer University. Recently I just graduated and am looking to
        contribute what I have learned to companies while learning new things
        along the way.

        <br />Currently I'm teaching myself web development so that I can become
        a front end developer/engineer.
